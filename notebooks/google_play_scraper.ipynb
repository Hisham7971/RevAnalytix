However, I wish Bisharp\\'s Evo was in the game. Also, it would be great to have a distance indicator for when you catch pokemon to have a better chance to get \"Great\" and \"Excellent\" throws. Another thing I feel like would be a great addition is to have the option to link the app to a fitness app, such as Fitbit, in terms of measuring walking distance for hatching eggs and such.', \"I really enjoyed playing this game and grinding on it, but lately, the new part where you can follow routes has been a really big, unsatisfying part. I especially don't like that I need to follow routes either to complete research tasks either because it is just inconvenient. I mainly play this game, walking to work or at the park. Im not trying to walk into areas I dont know or dont feel safe walking into just to complete this. I will say this really makes me not want to play really anymore.\", \"I just recently lost the ability to purchase coins in the app. I have a Android and there is no option to turn off purchases like there is in iPhones. I have triple checked all settings, uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice. It has got to be a app error because I can purchase things in other apps. This is very frustrating when I want to get remote raid passes and can't.\", 'I gave this app a bad review a while back because of issues making an account. I tried to redownload it a year or two later, and now it seems to be working fine. My only grievance with the game is the battle system. You charge up a special attack, and for some reason, even though I clicked it, it doesnt start up. But other than that ive been having fun playing it again', \"Great game, Routes and route creation could use major work. Tried to make a route that was 3.6 km long, and of course, I can't choose the end point that far away, so I elected to choose end point later. Got to the end of my envisioned route, and it then wanted me to select the start point again before being able to select the end point, which was the same issue as before, I couldn't because I'm too far away! A game that encourages exploration and walking, but only if it's short walks.\", \"Ever since the routes update (which I've still yet to discover one anywhere within a 50 mile radius) I've been having huge issues with the game freezing while trying to appraise my pokemon. Also, I've had issues with freezing when trying to receive and send gifts to friends as well as interact with the eggs. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing fixes the issues. The last update I had after routes made it even worse. Prior to this I had no issues. FYI I am a android user.\", 'Awesome game and totally free unless you decide to spend a few bucks for cool prizes, definitely not necessary though. The battle league is lots of fun, overall this game is the best way to kill time waiting in line or something. Others are complaining about recent crashes, my gf had a couple but I have thankfully not had to deal with that at all', \"I've been playing this game for about since it's been on for public, and I truly enjoyed finding routes, gyms, raids, battles, etc. But this update has been really rough. The game now crashes somewhat often, and the route update... Well, in kind way to say it, it makes the game MUCH much harder to find routes in. This game was amazing and I loved playing this, but if you don't fix this, I may have to stop playing because of continuing crashes, bugs, difficulties and more. Thank you!\", \"A good game but not at all inclusive; if you don't have the ability to walk miles everyday and travel to many countries you won't be able to do the main goal of the game; catch them all. Options that allow remote traveling would make the game playable for many more people but as is it is basically unplayable for many people, especially those with disabilities.\", \"I've been playing since launch, and the game has its ups and downs. Right now it is extremely frustrating after the introduction of routes. I just finished walking a 1k route on my lunch break. I spun every stop along the way and had no lag or lapsed service. So far the game only recognizes me as having walked 120 meters of the route. When I went through support, they said I needed to update the game. I did. Still no credit for walking the route, and now the app crashes every three minutes.\", \"Notifications are completely broken and do not work on my device, even after reinstall. New routes feature is unusable in my area and half-baked. Gift screen desperately needs an overhaul. Two simple buttons, one to send, one to receive would be much better than the current gift that overtakes the screen. App is going in reverse again and Niantic isn't listening to the player base.\", \"The game is fun as always, perfect for having some free time, but I wish it was easier to swap between accounts, like how instagram and Twitter have it easy. Also would like if customization wasn't so inferior, it would just be a bit more fun if you could look a little more like your trainer. Lastly (as im sure most people have asked for this) it would be fun to see other trainers around you (optional choice) just so it feels less alone, it can be a way to friend too.\", \"Fun game, but a bit buggy again. I've loved playing pokemon go for years now, but the routes update has been rough. It's really hard to find routes, even if they're just a few blocks away. But the worst part is that the app crashes consistently while following a route. I have no problem with using the app normally, but as soon as I start a route it crashes over and over again until I stop/end the route. Sometimes the crashes erase all progress I've made on said route. Hoping for a fix soon!\", 'Has its ups and downs. For a while it was almost completely impossible for me to make it past the loading screen despite saying it was compatible with my device, an issue that really only went away after getting a new phone. Was in an up period for these past couple months (because I could actually play), but now I keep getting AR scanning tasks. I had to look up how to do it because I seem to be incapable of doing despite being level 30? And it says you should only have to be level 20? Weird.', \"I find this game frustrating, there is a disadvantage to us people who live in rural areas compared to large cities. Not much for routes, if any so far I haven't found one, and defeating any bosses are out of the question when it's only one or two players. I wish the playing could be more accurate to the population of an area. I will not be spending anymore money as it is not worth it when everything is catered to large cities. Thanks for listening.\", \"The routes are a nice idea, but the system for them is confusing to work with. I can barely see what routes are listed on the bottom of the screen and can't view more than one at a time. The trail I started paused itself when I was nearly finished, and then resuming it told me that I had to start over from the part I'd started from. The rest of the game works fine, I'd just like to see more adjustments to the routes in the future.\", \"After thebSept update routes are broken. The don't finish now. When you pull one up that isn't near you, the route screen stays up even when you hit exit routes. Have to restart the game. Yes, I have cleared cached, data, and reinstalled. My friends have the same issue. Yes I have tried several different routes . Please fix asap. I can't do routes. Thanks\", \"I've loved this game since the very start and have played it ever since. The only issues I experience is that I live rurally where there is nothing, routes and Pokestops included, that I can do. Also, the monetization has gotten a bit worse. What used to be $1 is now $2 and a limit was put on raid passes, which severely lessened my playtime. Overall great game, just a few aspects need to be reworked.\", \"The game is too repetitive. I get that the point of the game is to walk while you are playing it. However, the game is basically unplayable when you just want to sit down and enjoy something. Also very pay to win. Kinda disappointed with the hype of it being the most played game at a point in time. Niantic clearly does not listen to the players. Nothing the players suggest are added or fixed. Hopefully when po go's rating decreases they will make the right choice.by then it's to late tho\", \"Wish game play was more stable. The issue of the week is that routes just don't open anymore. I can see them, but clicking one causes the routes screen to freeze in the foreground and I have to restart the app to clear it. Overall it's a great game, but for how much money they must be pulling it, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of beta testing (and don't even get me started how Niantic's response to customer feedback)...\", \"As Niantic has been constantly resricticting and reducing how people can play this game remotely, and increasing prices in the in game shop. They've made this game incredibly difficult to enjoy unless you live in a big city. It also runs poorly. 1 in 5 times trying to open the app it will just freeze. And even with having most of the data downloaded locally, it still frequently lags. Update: 7/21/23 Now you can't use the new routes feature without the game crashing.\", 'The new route feature is intriguing but isn\\'t ready for prime time. Too many messages about \"get closer\" and \"route paused\". Plus the routes just stop working while underway. Plus, the app crashes a few times during each route. The app version is current. Too much of a hassle to use right now.', 'Here we are, back once again. I attempted a few times to get Routes to actually function. When I go to a Route with the same start and end point, my whole game crashes. Fine, sure, maybe a coding error on that. But starting a Route with a different end point ALSO crashes my game and it makes the game borderline unplayable. Please fix.', 'At the moment I am very disappointed in this app. Ever since the routes came out I have been unable to do a route even though my town has two. Ever time I start a route the app freezes and closes then the only way I can get back into the app without it crashing is if I go completely away from the route start then quit the route. Due to this issue I am disappointed that I cannot enjoy all aspects of the game anymore. I had no problems before Pokémon routes came out!', \"This game demands a lot out of your phone for having such simple graphics and animations. I enjoy playing, but it is a real bummer that it overheats devices and closes the application. It also used to work smoothly over low bandwidth connections. Now, it takes forever to load. So when it crashes, I can't open it until I am on 5G or WIFI. Fire your development team and get some coders in there who can make GO run more efficiently, like it used to.\", \"It's... okay. But it could be soooo much more. The game is getting more expensive for arguably less fun experiences overall (expensive remote raid passes and shortened community days, anyone?). Also wish the interface was better after all these years. We need more information dense screens when trading Pokemon, for example. I also wish I could see the names of clothing/style items again...\", \"Routes, great in theory, poor in execution. I am one of the many that has crashes while doing routes. And while stubbling through the crashes, I am wondering how many zygarde cells I have missed. I've done 8 days worth of routes, 2 or 3 a day, only have 1 zygarde cell to show for it. Get this fixed guys, please. I am about ready to call it quits, and I used to love this game.\", \"Fun concept. But for the game to function in full, an individual is required to live in a large city with multiple friends available at all times. Overall it's a good concept, but it is not an inclusive game. The game is not centered around the enjoyment of the users. More about micro transactions than Pokemon.\", \"Could use improvements. Curve ball throws are just odd. I'd like to see type balls implemented. I would like to grow my own berries as well. Also, while this is a 'go' game and I understand the concept, I'm not capable of all the walking necessary to even get to the nearest stop. I have to drive which lowers the 'go' aspects anyway. Even if it's a premium or subscription feature a joystick, even if it moves slow, would be infinitely helpful.\", \"A Rediscovered Gem with Some Glitches Review: I recently rediscovered this game after taking a break for several years, and I must say, it's still a lot of fun. However, I've encountered some frustrating glitches that have hindered my experience. Firstly, I've noticed an issue with the game not registering my achievements accurately. For instance, today I threw three great curve balls, but only one of them was counted. It's disappointing when your efforts don't reflect in your progress.\", \"It's a wonderful game and I've been playing for quite some time now, but I must say it does need to be fixed here and there: For example the way remote raid passes work tend to mess up, raids tend to kick people out, the loading screen sometimes freezes, the game tends to crash every now and then, but other then those issues this game is perfect for a explorer and a collector! I diffently think you should download this game if you can get up and move around. Thanks for reading this!!\", \"Pokémon GO is actually still really fun for me to this day, and I hardly face any problems with it. However, there are so many bugs that have been a problem even since I first started playing back in 2018. For example: Team Rocket GO battles will sometimes bug out when your opponent sends out a different Pokémon, and the game 'freezes', forcing you to leave the battle. You can luckily still rematch, but it's just so frustrating. Besides that, my experience is, quite frankly, rather nice.\", 'The game in general is going well. I have problems with the routes, when I start running them the route pauses automatically after indicating the goal and no matter how many times I resume it pauses again. It is worth mentioning that I start them at the starting point and many times it tells me that I lack meters to reach the starting point when I am already there.', \"Updated: Almost 4 years to the day and I'm happy to report most hiccups have been fixed! Obviously an awesome game, the app can get a little glitchy or seems to get over loaded so I have to close and reopen often but the developers know what they're doing for the most part. One thing I really don't like is the raid battle notification pop ups, they're really annoying. There's always room for improvement but overall it's super enjoyable and motivating\", \"This is a great way to stay active although step tracking isn't as accurate as I wish it were. It WOULD BE AWESOME if they connected it to galaxy and Apple watches for better tracking and interaction. I also wish that they had a snapshot/sticker book instead of having to save to external and only using stickers to send away. It would also be nice to have a local find friends feature because it's hard to find players near you.\", \"I've been playing this game since it came out, and it's just isn't fun anymore. Everything just gets repetitive, bland, and boring. New events and pokemon are just not doing it anymore. The battle system sucks, the route system sucks, and the gym system sucks. I really wish battling was like the mainline games instead of just mindless tapping. And this isn't really the games fault, but I can't do any more than a level 3 raid because nobody around plays this game anymore. Niantic, fix your game.\", 'I love that this game brings Pokemon to the real world. I just always have a surplus of items and without the ability to spend money to upgrade. I am stuck to progress in some aspects. I would love if there was a feature where you could sell items back to them shop, to earn coin so then being able to afford upgrades. Allowing me to play more often.', 'Overall app is fine, it does the job however the option for \"native refreshrate\" should be asked from user when the game is opened for the first time in a separate prompt rather than letting be in settings because a lot of people who can play the game with much higher framerates doesn\\'t even bother to explore the settings and hence be deprived of a way more smoother game. Game lacks basic features like adding friends via profile, select and remove friends, send gifts to all, revive all, etc.', \"Had to come back and update. Talk about if something isn't broke don't fix it and that's exactly what happened here. The new update ruined everything. You'll lose battles raid they don't link the game shuts down and tells you to sign out. This has become an absolute trash game which is disappointing being as I've played this for a long time. Now it's just closing out of zero reasons. Can be in the middle of fights battles catches.\", \"I've had this game on and off since 2016. Its an alright game- but I think it's more suited to those who live in towns/cities rather than in the countryside 😂 Alot of the quests involve battling or those buggy mini-boss things on the spinneroo's (I don't remember what they're called), which is annoying, but I think that's just a personal thing. All round, it's a game, and it's fun enough to catch your pokeymans\"], 'appId': 'com.nianticlabs.pokemongo', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo&hl=en&gl=us'}\n"
