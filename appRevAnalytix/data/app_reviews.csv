So many strategies to use to build the levels/habitats. Short ads that sometimes freeze and don't give rewards but not often. It would be great if there was an option to skip the habitats you don't want to include. I've tried to keep my game humorous and fun. The rocket launch just doesn't seem to fit in for me. It takes up a lot of space, blocks the view of a lot of other more interesting things and adds a somewhat negative vibe to the game for me.",4,19,1.17,2021-05-23 11:55:25,"Hello, We will optimize and improve the game in the future, Thank you for your feedback and suggestions. feel free to contact us at penguinisle@habby.com.

I only have one problem though, the controls still need some tweaking. Moving around your island and scrolling through the page to upgrade things is not smooth and feels unpolished. This kinda gets annoying overtime and hard to deal with. Overall this game is very nice and with a little more tweaking I'd give it 5 stars.",4,26,1.26.2,2020-10-23 14:40:36,,,1.26.2

I do wish there were less reliance on ads, this definitely makes the game less relaxing. I'd love it a lot more if you could get coins by solving some sort of puzzle instead!! EDIT: With the updates there is less reliance on ads and a mini-game! If I could give this app more than 5 stars I definitely would!",5,241,1.32.0,2021-03-25 06:52:53,,,1.32.0

The biggest being that if you exit the game, without closing it completly, you do not get a returning bonus. The hourglass simply does not show up. In later stages of the game this is the only way to be able to purchase upgrades. Another issue is that whale bonues (the only other way to gain in game currency) do not load properly. TLDR: Very fun at first but underlying issues are a problem.",3,7,1.10,2019-12-15 20:40:50,"Hi, We are sorry to hear that you‚Äôve had a bad experience with the game.We will gradually improve the various systems in the game to enhance the player's game experience.We have recorded your feedback and suggestions to the planner.¬†Thank you for playing.",2019-12-16 04:27:22,1.10

You are forced into putting money into the game after that. Edit: The first areas and their levels are easy and quick to obtain. But once you hit Antarctic Base, it suddenly slows down, even using the variety of ads available. I would love to see a better balance implemented so I could continue getting more penguins üòÅüêß",1,18,1.07,2019-11-09 20:01:23,"Thank you very much for your review concerning our game.

The ut after a certain point theres literally nothing for you to do except watch ads to speed the money making process. No tapping for money, no anything. Just staring at the screen and waiting to be able to afford stuff. I like the premise, the music, everything else but theres literally nothing to do but watch ads for money now, and I hate that.",3,20,1.07,2019-11-16 21:35:58,"Thank you very much for your review concerning our game.

Music is peaceful, though the mood is broken every time an ad plays and I have to scramble to hit the mute button. Would be nice to have option to start those on mute. Also since the last update (Christmas update) the offline reward hasn't worked a single time when I just switch to a different app and come back hours later. I have to force close the game every time I stop playing if I want to get the offline reward when I come back. Please fix!",4,15,1.11,2020-01-04 18:56:03,SorryÔºåwe are working hard to fix it.

Just loads then crashes. It crashes upon saving images as well. Not sure if it's server space or just poor performance, but the only way for developers to make money off of ads is for users to actually have an opportunity to watch them, so it might be worth checking out! Super cute graphics, though. Most adorable mind numbing I've experienced.",5,12,1.27.2,2020-12-29 22:18:58,"Hi, please update the game to the latest version 1.28.1 and try again, we have fixed it, If you still have problems, please contact us at penguinisle@habby.com to help you.",2020-12-02 07:36:39,1.27.2

My only problems are that there's a limit of decorations, some points have very slow progression, and that there should maybe be something else to do other than just click, like some sort of minigame that you could play. It does affect battery life a bit when playing, but nothing too serious. Overall, I'd reccomend as a relaxing game.",4,82,1.26.2,2020-10-17 01:58:15,,,1.26.2

The ad rewards no longer work. They glitch out every time and I never get the reward for it. Especially with my offline one, it never gives me the reward and I can no longer watch ads for some reason to double it. Hasnt work since the new update but it ran fine before hand. I like the game and it can be a little challenge but still relaxing which is great. It has a wonderful balance between the two. I love all the penguins in the outfits! It's super cute.",4,4,1.07,2019-10-23 23:07:47,,,1.07
