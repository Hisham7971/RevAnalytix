Sentiment analysis and priority categorization for software reviews.

**Software Review Analysis**

This Git repository contains a Python-based software application review analysis tool. Our tool leverages natural language processing techniques to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews of software applications. In addition to sentiment analysis, it also provides a priority categorization system for negative reviews based on their severity.

**Key Features:**

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Our tool employs state-of-the-art NLP models to assess the sentiment of user reviews, providing insights into user satisfaction.

- **Priority Categorization:** Negative reviews are not created equal. Our system categorizes negative reviews into different priority levels based on the severity of issues raised.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** We offer a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction with the tool.

- **Data Visualization:** Visualize sentiment trends and priority distribution through intuitive charts and graphs.

- **Customization:** Configure the tool to adapt to specific domains or software applications for tailored analysis.

**Getting Started:**

To get started, simply clone this repository and follow the installation and usage instructions in the README file. You can quickly gain valuable insights from user reviews of your software and take informed actions to improve user satisfaction.

We welcome contributions and feedback from the open-source community to enhance the tool's functionality and usability.
